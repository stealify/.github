# The Stealify Project
A Set of Tools to Produce Cross Platform Arch Software with confidence including Web Driven Apps and Web Platforms as also Operating Systems. In general Stealify means To steal something in sense of doing awesomely. (a term invented by Frank Lemanschik) as also Stealifycation and Stealifyed.

## abstract the obvious keep the meaningful
The main goal of this project is a world where everything is under The Unlicense. As usage and education and keeping up with needs are hard enough to keep competition out of every market we do not need to make other people's life harder than it needs to be only because of some weird Idologic reasons. To reach that goal we needed a Framework for the Process that is the Stealify Component System it is based on 

## Based on the Composit / Modlet / Stream Patterns
We Enforce some high level principels to make your code more maintainable. You can google the terms from the above headline as i do not need to copy existing references at present. also see builtIn Features Section to get a grasp of what your getting here.

## builtIn Features
- Advisory Components a way to create Interface driven Advisory on Anything
  - Do stuff like installations, configurations, deployments, optimizations of costs, any thing a good consultant offers.
- CodeMod Components a way used most by Adivsory Components to introduce changes to existing code.
- reduces the amount of production code
- and reduces the amount of development source code
- making you a better programmer.
- reduces the number of failures and confusion while creating software.
- a completely new system designed from scratch taking only the parts of Open Source that make sense.
- allowing you to isolate software parts that make sense into independent components that run anywhere.
- leads to reusable code by design none reusable code is for example code that is so highly abstracted that you would skew your head off when you would understand and know what happens.

## Word Definitions 
- Steal is A little-known term used in the U.S military, typically used in the U.S. Marine Corps which stands for Strategically Taking Equipment to Another Location. It is a term used to justify taking something that doesn't belong to you when questioned by a superior who feels the action is immoral. STEALing most likely occurs while on deployment to a faraway country.
- sense Is something you can make, but only if you are born with it, although everyone has 7, some people can have 8 or more as well let us say 16. You can also have a sense of something eg bits, but even having all these bits doesn't mean everything makes sense. Got that? hint: - If not replace "in sense" with "in essence" then it makes sense.
- cation references to a technical exchange process you see that with other words like authentication which is a word that describes that there happens a multi-pass exchange process of user data.
- so Stealify means To steal something in sense of doing awesomely.
- and Stealification is the Automated exchange process between code and stealify that leads to a Stealifyed Product in mathematics, a product is the quantity obtained by multiplying two or more factors together.

## Downloading
We would suggest you to use VSStudio as entrance point into the ecosystem as it is composed out of all core parts and is used to streamline the assembling of stealify it self. It is at present largly dependent on vscode and our own editor @stealify/editor we merge port partial everything over to our own editor as it is based on better concepts and patterns. It is a Component Driven Editor not only for code for anything it offers generic interfaces like mouse movement keyboard interactions and is also reactive to its viewport and allows to get embedded integrated into anything that needs to track detailed interactions with a text box or fild in general.
