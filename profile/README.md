## Hi there 👋

## Structure
This is the Stealify Lang Project the Core of StealifyOS StealifyVM and other related projects stakeholders should look into https://github.com/stealify-backports and use issues and diskussions there.

# 🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about? 
Stealify Lang is all about Compiling Dynamic Code or Declarations into something that you can use.

# 🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
Most best is when you improve the Core Stakeholder Projects at present https://github.com/stealify-backports/ holds a list of that. 

# 👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
There are far to many docs at present that are needed and are topic domains specific in general we suggest:
- If your not familar with C and C++ learn it as also Optional Rust 
- then jump to  reading FuchsiaOS Docs Complet Even Play Around with that after full understanding of FuchsiaOS and its Principles and Goals Mainly the Zircon Kernel and the component Manager as also FIDL 
- you should jump into capnproto docs and the whole project but a good starting point is https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/blob/master/style-guide.md#raii-resource-acquisition-is-initialization

# 🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
At Present i am on a aggresiv Diet to get more healty this Epic Project Helps me to have something to focus on that worth my time and attention.

# 🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
I do not invest enough time into that but i should maybe do so once in a time i would love to get more people that know github markdown and could help me to write documentation I am also free for meetings just contact me on any Public Channel: Frank Lemanschik i would love to build a community of engineers that do not focus on a single Project i need Seniors and Passionated Juniors that want to address the fundamentals of Software Development Distribution and Architecture. Thanks for Reading i did not invest time into spell checking.
